	<h1>Opening tabs as another user</h1>

	<p>
		If you configured a tab to run a shell as a different user, you will be
		asked for a username and password before opening a tab. To use a domain
		account, enter your username in the form <i>domain</i>\<i>username</i>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Running a shell as a different user has some limitations:
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>User's HOME env. variable must be explicitly set</li>
			<li>
				If you're running 32-bit Console on 64-bit Windows and attempt to
				run cmd.exe as a shell, a 64-bit cmd.exe will be started and crash.
			</li>
			<li>
				Currently, other user's environment is not loaded and expanded. You can't
				use env. variables in the shell and startup directory parameters.
			</li>
			<li>
				As a consequence, if you leave the shell parameter empty, cmd.exe will 
				be used as a shell, not other user's COMSPEC variable.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
