	<h1>Language</h1>

	<p>
		Here's how to properly setup your language and font settings for Console.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Please read this carefully</b>, especially if you're using 
		double-width character languages. As far as I know, they're:
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Japanese Shift-JIS (codepage 932)</li>
			<li>Simplified Chinese GBK (codepage 936)</li>
			<li>Korean (codepage 949)</li>
			<li>Traditional Chinese Big5 (codepage 950)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		So, to setup your language:
		
		<ol>
			<li>
				Start registry editor (Start->Run, type regedit). Find 
				HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console key. If there is a subkey named 
				"Console2 command window", delete it.
				<br /><br />
				<b>NOTE:</b> PLEASE be careful when deleting stuff from 
				registry. You can break things.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Open Control Panel and run "Regional and Language options". Go 
				to "Advanced" tab. In the "Language for non-Unicode programs" 
				find your language. This is especially critical for double 
				width character languages. Click OK. you may get a dialog 
				saying that required files are already installed on the hard 
				disk. You can click 'yes' here to skip installing language 
				files from a Windows CD/DVD. After that you will get 'restart 
				computer' dialog. Click yes.			
			</li>
			
			<li>
				After restart, run Console. Unhide windows console 
				(View->Console window) and open its properties dialog. Go to 
				"Font" tab. Raster Fonts will be selected in the fonts list. 
				Choose the other, TrueType font. For most languages, this will 
				be Lucida Console. For double-width character languages, these 
				should be proper fonts (I don't read Japanese/Chinese/Korean 
				ideograms, I just read these from the registry :-)
				<br /><br />
				<ul>
					<li>Japanese (932) - MS Gothic</li>
					<li>Simplified Chinese (936) - NSimSun</li>
					<li>Korean (949) - GulimChe</li>
					<li>Traditional Chinese (950) - MingLiU</li>
				</ul>
				
				Anyway, select proper TrueType console font and set its size 
				to something small (8 or 10 points). Small size will allow you 
				bigger max Console window size.
				<br /><br />
				Click OK. "Apply Properties" dialog will appear, select "Save 
				properties for future windows with same title" and click OK. 
				This will save Windows console settings for Console. You can 
				check your registry again, HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console key. 
				There should be "Console2 command window" subkey there again.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				You can now open Console settings and choose whatever 
				fixed-width font you like (make sure it has characters you 
				need :-)
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunatelly, all of this is needed due to historic reasons: Windows 
		console still uses codepages, and this seems to be the only way to set 
		all of the options properly.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>NOTE:</b> I have noted that even Windows console shows some strange 
		behavior with double-width character languages. As usual, if you 
		notice something strange, unhide the hidden console window first and 
		check what's happening there.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>NOTE 2:</b> When Console gets setup procedure, 
		non-DBCS-language-users will not have to do this. Setup procedure will 
		do this automagically. I will try to automate this for our 
		Japanese/Chinese/Korean friends :-)
	</p>
	
	<p>
		I hope I haven't forgotten anything... I tested this on Japanese Win2k 
		and WinXP with East Asian Language support installed, so it should 
		work.
