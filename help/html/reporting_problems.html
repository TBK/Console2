	<h1>Reporting problems</h1>
	
	<p>
		Half of the work in fixing a bug can be done by properly reporting it. 
		Just creating a bug report and saying "This does not work" is clearly 
		not good enough. When fixing bugs, most of my time is usually wasted on 
		finding details for these bug reports.
	</p>
	<p>
		Please follow these guidelines when reporting problems:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Please use Console's SF bug reporting <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=437332&amp;group_id=43764&amp;func=browse">page</a>.
			Reporting bugs elsewhere (like the forum) is not a good idea, since 
			they may get lost and forgotten.
		</li>
		<li>
			Write Console and Windows version you're using.
		</li>
		<li>
			Attach your configuration file.
		</li>
		<li>
			Attach screenshots if they illustrate your problem.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you can, describe in detail the symptoms and steps to reproduce 
			them. If I can't reproduce the bug, it's usually very difficult to 
			fix it.
		</li>
		<li>
			If Console output seems strange/garbled/broken, unhide the hidden 
			console window (View->Console window). If its output looks the same, 
			it's probably not a Console issue. Some console applications can 
			behave strangely.
		</li>
		<li>
			Try to eliminate other utilities you run that could interfere with 
			Console (hotkey managers, etc).
		</li>
	<ul>
