		Tip 1 - Full console replacement
	</h2>
	
	<p>
		Console can completely replace your console windows, but you need to
		dig around the Registry.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is a key in the Registry that allows you to specify some options
		for starting processes: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options.
		(HKLM stands for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key)
	</p>
	<p>
		For testing purposes, create a subkey named 'notepad.exe' (no quotes).
		In it, create a string value with name 'Debugger' and value 'calc.exe'
		(again, no quotes). Now, try running notepad. Calculator will be 
		started instead! Cool! Don't forget to delete 'notepad.exe' key when
		done.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now, for each console process you'd like to replace, you need to 
		create one such key with 'Debugger' value set to run Console. Let's 
		do it with cmd.exe:
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				Create a subkey named 'cmd.exe'.
			</li>
			<li>
				In it, create a string value named 'Debugger' and set its 
				value to 'C:\Program Files\Console\Console.exe -dbg' (path to
				Console.exe may be different on your computer)
			</li>
			<li>
				Try running cmd.exe now!
			</li>
			<li>
				If you wish Console to be started with a specific config file
				and/or tab name, put -c and -t command line options before 
				-dbg option:
				<br /><br/>
				'C:\Program Files\Console\Console.exe -c console_dbg.xml -t 
				console2 -dbg'
			</li>
		</ul>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Notes:</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Creating a key like this will affect any program instance. For 
			example, if cmd.exe is used to run batch files, starting a batch
			file from Windows explorer, Console will be started. Some 
			applications (like Visual Studio) start shell instances to perform 
			some tasks. Consider yourselves warned, things may go wrong.
		</li>
		<li>
			This approach is a possible virus attack vector. Antivirus 
			programs might consider these keys to be a virus attack.
		</li>
		<li>
			This feature is considered a bit advanced and unsafe. That's why 
			you can't configure it in Console.
		</li>
	</ul>
